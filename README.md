## Git and Github
Git vs. Github

git commands are the same on all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux)

`git status`: 

When a new Python file named `example_script.py` is added to the repo, running `git status` will show the new file. It is listed as untracked since it is not currently a part of the repo until it is has been committed

```
user@linux-os:~/Desktop/esds-github-sandbox$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	example_script.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

`git add`:

```
```
`git commit`:
